            <p>
              Becoming a developer was inspired by wanting to pursue a career as a creative director. <br> I really enjoyed the brand strategizing and visual storytelling aspects of the creative and marketing worlds, but I had to make my designs functional and was frustrated with my limited options in creating user interfaces and websites. I found myself digging into code to make things look and work right.
              <br>
              I am super passionate about building multi-functional websites utilizing video and graphics. <br> I am equally as fascinated and interested in learning the how to build the framework behind the user experience.

                I work primarily in the content marketing space providing brand strategy, and written, visual and interactive content. I'm looking forward to being able to further develop my niche with the ability to create the website, and develop both the front and back end of the website for the most functional, effective, and engaging user experience.

                I enjoy working with clients in the content marketing space providing brand strategy, and written, visual and interactive content. I'm looking forward to combining my web development and creative skill sets in future projects.
